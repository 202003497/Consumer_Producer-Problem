# Consumer_Producer-Problem
The File labelled "Producer_Consumer_Final-Draft.ipnb" is a python file which comprises of the producer consumer code whereby the producer produces data that contains student information and store the data in a ITstudents class. The producer then wraps the student information into XML format then place the XML file in directory it shares with the buffer.
The consumer reads the content of the xml file it shares with the buffer and then unwrap an XML file and gather the XML file student information into a ITstudent class. The consumer calculates the average mark based on the marks allocated to the courses thendetermine whether the student has passed or failed with the pass mark set at 50%.
The shared buffer ensures that the producer and consumer processes can access the data safely and efficiently.
The file labelled "Socket_Program for Producer Consumer" implements the producer and consumer problem using socket programming in Python. The producer generates student information and stores it in an ITstudents class. The consumer reads the information, performs calculations, and prints the results. The producer and consumer communicate through a shared buffer using sockets. The code also includes the necessary functions to generate random student information and create XML files
